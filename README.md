# Taolin #

[Taolin](http://taolin.fbk.eu) is an open source Web desktop created in the research institute Fondazione Bruno Kessler ([FBK](http://www.fbk.eu)).

The web desktop consists of a personal dashboard customisable by adding micro-applications called widgets. Each widget offers a different service that can be provided as a view over internal services or repositories (e.g. access to papers repository) or as a communication service (e.g. jabber web chat) or as an external resource (e.g. Google search). 


## Technology ##
Taolin relies on a 3-tier architecture: the back-end has been developed using [CakePHP](www.cakephp.org) (a Model-View-Controller framework) over a [PostgreSQL](www.postgresql.org) database (chosen for its stability and reliability), while the front-end takes advantage of the usage of JavaScript and AJAX (the framework adopted for the development is [ExtJS](http://extjs.com), integrated with [jQuery](http://www.jquery.com)). JSON (JavaScript Object Notation, a lightweight data-interchange format) is used for the data transmission between back-end and front-end.
